# LifeChoices: a social media decision-making app
This app will help people make life choices (big and small) by allowing friends to comment and vote on a choice.  

## Project Description 
"Live Choices" is MERN stack web application that helps users post choices that other users can vote and discuss.  After a landing page that lists all choices, users can review choices, vote on their preference, and comment on why their vote is the best choice.  

Should I move to Canada or Mexico?  Should I order Chinese or Burgers?  Finally we can make the right choice!
